# Animal Crossing Music Android App  
  
First app of mine for practicing my skills.   
I know a lot of people love the in-game hourly music from Animal Crossing.
So thought this would be a fun project to do for those fans.   
I will be uploading it to Google Play, but for those who want to see the code, here ya go. Be warned that it is not pretty but hey it works...
  
Thanks for checking out my first Android app.  
  
## Disclaimer

I don't claim to own the music in the app or the Animal Crossing name.  
Those rights go to Nintendo for that amazing game. :)
